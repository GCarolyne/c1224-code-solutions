## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of a loop?

1. Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times.
2. Working with Collections: Meaning they are great for working with collections of data, such as arrays or objects. You can use a loop to iterate over each item in the collection and perform an operation on it.
3. Efficientcy.
4. Control flow: loops in combination with conditional statements , allow you to control the flow of your program in complex ways.

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  It will make the code run until the condition results to false.

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  for loops have an initial expressioin that is typically used to define the i variable or the variable that is keeping track of the current iteration.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  Right away in the conditional expression.
  inside the loop index gets incremented so that eventually index will be the desired number. This way our loop will know when to stop.

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The initial expression only runs once before the loop begins to iterate.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The conditional expression runs before each iteration of the loop, so our code knows weather to continue or terminate the loop.
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The final expression gets evaluated after each iteration.
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  break
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  Increments the result of the loop by one?
- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  Using a for in loop which is specially designed for objects and keys.
