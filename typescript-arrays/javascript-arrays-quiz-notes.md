## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are arrays used for?

1. Organizing Data: Arrays allow you to store multiple values in a single variable.
   This can be useful when you want to group related data together.

2. Ordering: Arrays are ordered, meaning that the items in an array have a specific order.
   This can be useful when the order of your data matters.

3. Built in Methods: Javascript arrays come with many built in methods that make it easy to manipulate and interact with data.

4. Iteration: Arrays can be easily iterated over, allowing you to perform operations on each item in the array.

5. Flexibility: Arrays in JS are dynamic and can hold items of any type. An array can contain a mix of strings, numbers, objects, other arrays, etc.

- Describe array literal notation.

A variable is being defined by the const or let followed by the equal symbol followed by brackets and information spaced throughout with commas.

- How are arrays different from "plain" objects?

Arrays are used to store ordered collections of values. Plain objects are used to store key value pairs.

Indexing vs Keys
Arrays = Use numerical indices to access elements.
Objects = Use strings or symbols as keys.

Prototype and Built in Methods
Arrays = Inherit from array.prototype and include methods like .push()..
Objects = Inherit from Object.prototype and include methods like .keys()..

Iteration

Arrays = Designed for ordered iteration. Use loops like for, for..of, .forEach()
Objects = Not designed for sequential iteration. Use for... in or Object.keys(), Object.values()

Length Property
Arrays = Have a built in length property that automatically updates as elements are added or removed.
Objects = No automatic length property. You need to calculate the size manually using Object.keys(obj).length

Data Representation
Arrays = Ordered , Indexed collection
Objects = Unordered key-value pairs

- What number represents the first index of an array?

An array starts with the number 0.

- What is the `length` property of an array?

The length property allows us to access the length of the array.

- How do you calculate the last index of an array?

It will be the full array.length -1
