## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Give 6 examples of comparison operators.
  equal (==) , not equal(!=), strict equal (===), strict not equal (!==), greater than (>), less than(<)
- What data type do comparison expressions evaluate to?
  Boolean
- What is the purpose of an `if` statement?
  it is to evaluate if a condition is true. Inside of the parentheses, an expression needs to go inside so that there is a condition that our code is checking for.
- Is `else` required in order to use an `if` statement?
  We need a if statement along side a else if we need to evaluate to true and false and check for those results.
- Describe the syntax (structure) of an `if` statement.
  if (boolean expression) {code block that excutes if the conditional evaluates to true. }
- What are the three logical operators?
  logical AND &&
  logical OR ||
  logical NOT !
- How do you compare two different expressions in the same condition?
  logical operators
- What is the purpose of a `switch` statement?
  The switch statement is usefull to use when we have a collection of conditions or cases that need to be checked against.
- Is a `default` clause required in order to use a `switch` statement?
  No, it is optional. A default clause can technically be omitted but its a nice way to handle a final catch all in case any previous clauses did not excute.
