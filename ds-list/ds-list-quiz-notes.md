## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Briefly describe the List data structure.
  A list is a sequence of elements that allows for ordered storage of data. Unlike arrays, which have a fixed size in many programming languages, lists can dynamically grow or shrink as needed. Elements in a list are typically accessed by their position (index).
- What are some examples of when you would use a List?
  To-do applications: Tasks are stored in order and can be added, removed, or reordered
  Music playlists: Songs arranged in sequence with the ability to add or remove tracks
  Browser history: Websites visited in chronological order
  Shopping carts: Items added by customers while shopping online
  Command history: Previous commands executed in a terminal or application
- How do you read an element of a List given its index? What is its time complexity?
  With bracket notation element index time times the size of the element and add offset . 3 \* 4 + 500.
  This will tell us the memory location for any list. Constant time because the memeory is constant we search for the list in the same amount of time not depending on its size it will take the same time.
- How do you add an element into a List at a given index? What is its time complexity?
  Shift everything over and insert a new one. This is linear complexity.
- How do you update an element in a List at a given index? What is its time complexity?
  I am writing a new value onto that is already there. SO first find memory location and than edit and update the 200. You can over write what is there. Constant time.
- How do you remove an element from a List at a given index? What is its time complexity?
  access the location and remove it.
