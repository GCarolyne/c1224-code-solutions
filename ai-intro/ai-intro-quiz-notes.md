## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Will AI replace software developers?

AI will not replace software developers but will help them to become more efficient and faster.

What AI Can Do:
Automating Repetitive Tasks: AI tools like code autocompletion, debugging assistants, and template generation (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Tabnine) are excellent at speeding up repetitive or boilerplate coding tasks.
Enhancing Productivity: AI can help with identifying bugs, suggesting optimizations, and even generating code snippets, enabling developers to focus on higher-level problem-solving.
Creating Prototypes: AI models can generate functional prototypes or simple applications from high-level descriptions, streamlining the early stages of software development.
Improving Testing: AI tools can automate software testing, generate test cases, and predict vulnerabilities.

AI is more likely to act as a powerful collaborator rather than a replacement.

- What is the best way to use AI tools when learning software development?

Ask questions about coding syntax.
Ask it to explain code, concepts.
Ask it to offer suggestions or identify errors in the code, or provide quiz questions.

Enhance understanding of concepts
Practice coding with guidance
Learn by doing
Improve debugging and problem solving
Explore best practices
Develop a Habit of Learning
Avoid Over Reliance
Combine AI with Other Resources

- What is the danger of using AI tools for software development while I'm still learning?

Not learning , relying to much on AI and its quick answers.
Over reliance on AI
Lack of Deep Understanding
Poor code quality habits
Incomplete or Inaccurate Code
Skipping problem solving steps
Misaligned learning Pace
How to Mitigate These Risks
Balance Manual and AI-Assisted Work: Alternate between writing code on your own and using AI for guidance.
Focus on Fundamentals: Spend time understanding core concepts like algorithms, data structures, and software design.
Test AI-Generated Code: Always validate the output with thorough testing.
Seek Feedback: Share your work with mentors, peers, or communities to get feedback beyond what AI offers.
Be Curious: Use AI as a learning tool by asking "why" and "how" to deepen your understanding of its suggestions.
