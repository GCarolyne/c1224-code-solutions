## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of variables?
  Variables are used to store value in, for example like a labeled box. We can refer to this box by its label whenever we need to access the contents inside of it.

- How do you **declare** a variable?
  We declare a variable by using var, let or const.

- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?

With the equal = symbol this is used as the assignment operator.
It assigns the value on its right to the variable on its left.

- What characters are allowed in variable names?

Characters can include letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.

- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?

Variable names are case sensitive - meaning that the capitalization matters. Two variables with the same name, but with different capitalization, are treated as 2 separate variables.

- What is the purpose of a string?

Strings are used to represent text . But can be accessed through indexes as an array.

- What is the purpose of a number?

Numbers can be assigned to variables directly.

- What is the purpose of a boolean?

Booleans are typically used in conditional testing where we need to decide the path of code to execute based on the truthiness of a condition. Boolean values can be created directly by assigning true or false variables.

- What does the `=` operator mean in JavaScript?

It is the assignment operator.

- How do you update the value of a variable?

We can update the value of a variable by using the equal = symbolism.

- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?

Undefined represents the absence of any value.
Null is used intentionally to represent no value or empty value. It must be assigned explicitly to a variable.

The main differences are:
1.Type - The type of undefined is undefined, while null is an OBJECT. 2. Intention - undefined typically indicates that a variable has not been initialized, while null is used to intentionally denote the absence of any value.

Usage in code:
Use undefined to check if a variable has not been initialized.
Use null to explicitly set a variable with no current value (especially when dealing with objects)

- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?
  For debugging purposes.

- Give five examples of JavaScript primitives.
  number, string, boolean, null, undefined
